# Helmet detection on two wheeler using Machine Learning

A object detection is done using a Machine learning  algorithm which can detect Motorcycle riders. Then Helmet detection is applied if helmet is not detected then number plate detection is done.
First of all from a image input , Motorcycle detection is done.Then Helmet detection is done on each of those detected bikes. In case if helmet is not detected then number plate detection is applied.

Bike detection and helmet detection is done using YOLO V3 and for number plate detection is done using haarcascade.
